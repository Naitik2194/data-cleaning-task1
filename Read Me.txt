# 🎬 Netflix Dataset Cleaning – Internship Task 1

Hi! This repository contains my solution for **Task 1** of the Data Analyst Internship – focused on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset using Excel.

---

## 📝 Task Overview

The goal was to take a raw dataset (with missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, etc.) and clean it up so it's ready for analysis. I used Excel to handle everything step-by-step.

## 📂 About the Dataset

- The dataset is a simulated sample of Netflix titles with 100 entries.
- Original file: `netflix_titles_raw_100.csv`
- Cleaned version: `netflix_titles_cleaned.xlsx`

## 🧹 What I Did (Cleaning Steps)

Here’s a quick summary of the cleaning process:

- **Renamed columns** to be lowercase and consistent (e.g., `date_added`, `release_year`)
- **Removed duplicate rows** using Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” feature
- **Handled missing values**:
  - Replaced empty cells in `director` and `cast` with “Not specified”
  - Replaced empty cells in `country` and `rating` with “Unknown”
- **Fixed date format** in `date_added` to be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format
- **Checked data types**, especially making sure `release_year` was numeric

## 💻 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
  (Used filters, formulas, and built-in cleaning tools)

## 📁 Files Included

- `netflix_titles_raw_100.csv` – the original raw dataset
- `netflix_titles_cleaned.xlsx` – cleaned version in Excel
- `README.md` – this file

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

This task helped me get hands-on practice with real-world data issues like missing values and inconsistent formats. Cleaning data is such an important part of analysis, and this was a great way to build confidence using Excel for that.

Thanks for checking out my work!
